# Resistance Calculator

This React-based web application allows you to calculate the resistance of an electrical resistor based on the colors of its bands. Additionally, it provides additional information such as minimum resistance, maximum resistance, and tolerance in percentage form.

## Features

-   **Resistance Calculator:** Enter the colors of the bands and obtain the resistance value.
-   **Additional Information:** The application also displays minimum resistance, maximum resistance, and tolerance.
-   **Attractive Interface:** Styles are implemented using tailwindcss, providing a modern and pleasing interface.
-   **Modal Window:** SweetAlert2 is used to display a modal window with resistance information.

## Usage

1. Open the web application in your browser.
2. Enter the colors of the resistor bands.
3. Obtain the values for resistance, minimum resistance, maximum resistance, and tolerance.

## Technologies Used

-   **React:** User interface development.
-   **JavaScript:** Main programming language.
-   **Tailwind CSS:** Style framework used for design.
-   **SweetAlert2:** Library for displaying attractive modal windows.
